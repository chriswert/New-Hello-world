        <p>I am the son of a 30 year Air Force Chief Master Sargent. I spent most of my childhood living in either Italy
            and Germany. After graduation from High School in Germany I came back to Arizona and went to the University
            of Arizona. There I met my wife of 20 years. I finished my degree with Northern Arizona University while my
            wife went to Law School at the University of Gonzaga. After returning to Arizona, I started a career in the
            Golf Industry. I started at the bottom, working as an outside golf attendent. It then moved into the golf
            shop where I became more familiar with the operations part of a golf course. I also began to teach golf
            lessons. I eventually was hired by OB Sports where I became an Account Manager. I managed 35 golf course
            email marketing and website support.</p>
