            <p><center>I am the son of a 30 year Air Force Chief Master Sargent. I spent most of my childhood living in either
                Italy
                and Germany. After graduation from High School in Germany I came back to Arizona and went to the
                University
                of Arizona. There I met my wife of 20 years. I finished my degree with Northern Arizona University while
                my
                wife went to Law School at the University of Gonzaga. After returning to Arizona, I started a career in
                the
                Golf Industry. I started at the bottom, working as an outside golf attendent. I then moved into the
                golf
                shop where I became more familiar with the operations part of a golf course. I also began to teach golf.
                I eventually was hired by OB Sports where I became an Account Manager. I managed 35 golf course
                email marketing and website support.</center></p>
